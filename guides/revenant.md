So, you want to start doing revenant (rev) slayer and don't know where to start? Well, you have came to the right place!
Let's get started!

## Revenant Tier 1  
- Gear: Nothing  
- Weapon: Undead sword or Rogue sword  
- Pet: None

Notes: This tier is very easy to defeat. It only has 500 hp so it will only take a few hits.

## Revenant Tier 2  
- Gear: Full Glacite or Ender armour  
- Weapon: Aspect of the end  
- Pet: Grandma wolf (common) or enderman (rare)

Notes: Tier 2 is much more harder then tier 1, requiring armour this time and a better weapon. Again it's not that hard
to defeat so you shouldn't have trouble with it.

## Revenant Tier 3  
- Gear: Strong dragon  
- Weapon: Dreadlord sword  
- Pet: Enderman (epic)

Notes: Tier 3 also isn't that hard with this setup. You just need to hit the boss with your sword and if you get low you
can use a healing wand.

## Revenant Tier 4  
- Gear: Strong dragon  
- Weapon: Revenant falchion or livid dagger  
- Pet: Enderman (epic) or tiger (uncommon or rare)

Notes: Tier 4 is what you will be doing until you get revenant slayer 7 which is when you can do tier 5s. Tier 4s aren't
too much different from tier 3s other than they have more hp and do more damage. I suggest you get a higher skyblock
level and combat level before doing these.

## Revenant Tier 5  
- Gear: Full shadow assassin  
- Livid dagger or reaper falchion  
- Pet: Baby yeti (epic)

Notes: Tier 5 has a lot more HP then the tier 4 and does a lot more damage. What you need to do is to move around the
boss so the TNT can't hit you. Also, every 30 seconds the boss starts spawning bedrock on the ground and when it
finishes charging up it instantly kills you so I suggest moving away when that happens. When you start doing tier 5s,
you can start dropping “good” RNG drops.

Congratulations! You have defeated every tier of the Revenant slayer! Now go get revenant slayer 9 and get your RNG
drops (and probably lose money).
