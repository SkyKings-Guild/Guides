How To Get An Egg in Hypixel Skyblock

Getting your hands on an egg in Hypixel Skyblock is relatively straightforward. Here are the steps to follow:

Find a Chicken in The Barn or next to Gilliver in Jerry's Workshop: Chickens can be found roaming around The Barn or near Gilliver in Jerry's Workshop. Approach one of them to interact with it.

Wait for the Chicken to lay an egg: Once you've located a chicken, be patient and wait for it to lay an egg. Chickens typically lay eggs periodically, so keep an eye on them.

Alternate Method for Faster Egg Collection:

If you're looking to collect eggs more efficiently, consider this alternate method:

Craft a Chicken Minion: Defeat chickens in The Barn to obtain chicken minions. To create a chicken minion, you'll need a specific amount of raw chicken drops from slain chickens. Access your crafting table and craft a chicken minion using these materials.

Place Chicken Minions on Your Island: After crafting chicken minions, place them on your island in a suitable location. Ensure you have sufficient space for them to operate.

Add a Hopper Below the Chicken Minions: To automate egg collection, place hoppers beneath your chicken minions. This setup will automatically collect eggs as the minions produce them.

Wait for Them to Lay Eggs: Now, all you need to do is be patient and let your chicken minions work their magic. They will lay eggs over time, which will be collected by the hoppers, making the egg-gathering process much more efficient.

By following these methods, you'll be well on your way to amassing a collection of eggs in Hypixel Skyblock, which you can use for various crafting purposes. Enjoy your adventures in the world of Skyblock!
