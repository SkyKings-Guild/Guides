Tips for all tiers: Try to have shelmet as your pet item as it helps out a lot during the boss. Make sure you have vitality on your crimson or 
else you won't be able to survive. If you have a Warden Helmet and the less vitality doesn't really effect you, try using it for more dps. You
should also be using either full crimson equipment set or full vanquished equipment set for all tiers (excluding tier 1) for the extra damage and 
damage reduction. Try to have vitality on your equipment for the extra healing. For the second attributes, try using dominance for extra damage
or veteran for faster spawning.

## Part 2: Places to spawn and cheese

Blaze slayer spawns Fire pits that hits hard, BUT you can completely cheeze with certain block like

- Standing inside a Skull by etherwarping its lower block
- Standing on a half slab ( any kind of slab works)
- Standing while on the extreme corner of a block


If any of above conditions match, the fire pit will not spawn below you, hence it will not hit you while slayer gaming.


After Follow all above rules you should be able to solo any tier blaze, if you cant try using Wisp's Ice Flavored water potion or adding opal gemstone on your armor.
