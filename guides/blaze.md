So you're struggling with blaze slayer? Well, you have come to the right place! Here you will learn how to defeat all tiers of blaze slayer
bosses, places to spawn and cheese the boss and extra info about blaze slayer. Now, lets get into it.

## Part 1: Gear Requirements

### Tier 1

Armour: Full Superior / Shadow Assassin

Pet(s): Rare Lion (shelmet is recommended)

### Tier 2

Sword: Firedust Dagger, Twilight Dagger

Armour: Full Hot Crimson

Pet(s): Epic Lion, Epic Tiger

Tips: If you can't survive, try putting 1 piece of sorrow on.

### Tier 3

Sword: Kindlebane Dagger, Mawdredge Dagger

Armour: Full Hot Crimson 10✪

Pet(s): Legendary Griffin (Recommended), Wolf/Wisp (Spawning)

Tips: If you can't survive, try putting on a sorrow chestplate

### Tier 4

Sword: Kindlebane Dagger, Mawdredge Dagger

Armour: 3/4 Burning Crimson 5✪, Sorrow Chestplate

Pet(s): Legendary Griffin (Cheap), Legendary Enderdragon (Recommended), Wolf/Wisp (Spawning)

Tips: In the second demons phase, at the end try to swap out your crimson leggings for sorrow leggings if you cant survive.


Utilities for all tiers: Moody Grappleshot (For Spawning), Wand of Atonement, Any Power Orb, Gloomlock (Not Needed but Reccomended), 
Withercloak (for pillars), Wisp Potion (if you're dying), Florid Zombie Sword


Tips for all tiers: Try to have shelmet as your pet item as it helps out a lot during the boss. Make sure you have vitality on your crimson or 
else you won't be able to survive. If you have a warden helmet and the less vitality doesn't really effect you, try using it for more dps. You
should also be using either full crimson equipment set or full vanquished equipment set for all tiers (excluding tier 1) for the extra damage and 
damage reduction. Try to have vitality on your equipment for the extra healing. For the second attributes, try using dominance for extra damage
or veteran for faster spawning.
