With all the money making methods out there, farming has to be one of the greatest
of them, being almost fully afk-able and making upwards to 10m per hour and almost 
16m an hour while being maxed, so you might be asking, what crop should I be farming
to make the most? Well then, you came to the right place!

Before we start you must keep in mind that a mooshroom cow is always better for coins
over elephant, but you'll be going to loose quite the amount of collection.

While using bountiful with a decent setup and a melon dicer, you'll be going to be
getting the most amount of coins, ranking as best with a potentail 16m per hour
with a maxed setup, and keep in mind that all of this is NPC price so these rates
will never change, and if you want to know all the other crops coins per hour,
here is a detailed sheet with the maxed coins for each crop!
