### How To Get Dirt In Hypixel Skyblock

Obtaining dirt in Hypixel Skyblock is straightforward, and you have two primary methods at your disposal:

By utilizing these methods, you can ensure a steady supply of dirt in Hypixel Skyblock for all your island-building endeavors. Whether you choose to mine it from your starting island or purchase it from the Builder NPC, dirt is an essential resource that will aid you in creating the Skyblock island of your dreams.
