Accesories are one of the most important items in Skyblock, yes more important than that Hyperion you've been trying to
save for. Essentially, Accessories or Talismans give you Magic Power which buff the Powers you can get from Maxwell in
the hub.

There's a huge range of Power Stones available and you should browse the wiki to find the ones you think you need the
most.  
Some to consider that are affordable are:

* Silky - Archer/Berserker
* Bloody - Archer/Berserker
* And Sighted - Mage

So you may be thinking, "How many talismans do I need?" The simple answer is, all of them. Just buy as may as you can
afford, some of them are a few thousand coins to a few hundred million coins. As a goal, try and hit the following magic
power milestones: 100, 250, 500, 750+ - As you hit those numbers you'll start noticing potentially huge improvements on
your damage, health, attack speed, and intelligence.

How to hit those numbers? Well you need unique talismans, that includes the rarity. So for example you can't have a
Scarf's Thesis and Scarf's Grimoire as it will just only count for the best one you have. The best advice to give is,
buy all of the ones from the server hub NPCs, complete all of the races that give you free ones (End Race, Woods Race,
Chicken Race or The Dungeon hub races) and then start looking at resources such as SkyCrypt or find a Discord server
that has the SkyHelper bot, this will show you what you're missing and what to buy in order based on cost per magic
power gained.

When you hit a point where you feel like the talismans are reaching a cost that doesn't seem worth it you can consider
recombobulating talismans, I would recombobulate any talismans that the max level is legendary or epic which means
you'll be able to get them to mythic and legendary respectively - once you recom those consider recoming rare to epic
etc.

Now you have a load of talismans you might notice your accessory bag is starting to look a bit full. You should
definitely consider farming out your redstone collection until it is maxed which will give you 57 slots in your bag once
it's maxed. You can also gain more slots from Jacobus (eventually gives you a talisman but very expensive) or the
community shop.

Enrichments is another aspect of accessories that provide a small stat boost to each accessory to let you min max your
stats. These can be purchased from the auction house or community shop and can be swapped with an enrichment swapper. I
would recommend hitting 500-750+ MP before considering using these when you need to tweak your stats.
