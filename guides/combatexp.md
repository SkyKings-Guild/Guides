Here are some of the main methods for grinding combat XP, along with their requirements and rates. They are listed in
order from easiest to hardest:

1. Pigman/Crypt Ghoul grinding:

* Requirements: Any decent early-game sword, such as an undead sword, and Lapis/Hardened Diamond/Ember armor.
* Rates: Very low, around 20k per hour, but mainly used for unlocking the end. Crypt ghouls give more XP but are harder
  to kill.

3. 9k hp Enderman:

* Requirements: Ender/Ember armor and an Aote/Raider's Axe.
* Rates: 100k-200k per hour. Recommended to use until around combat 20, using a god pot for more XP and a legendary wolf
  if possible.

5. T3 Revs:

* Requirements: Preferably wise with a Frozen Scythe and an Ink Wand.
* Rates: 300k-400k per hour. You will lose some money, but leveling pets can make up for it. Use the Ink Wand to
  one-shot the boss.

7. T4 Revs:

* Requirements: Same as T3 Revs but with Shadow/Wither Goggles to increase damage and a Midas Staff to deal with
  minibosses and avoid cooldown.
* Rates: 600-700k per hour. However, you will lose a significant amount of money (4m+ per hour), making this method only
  viable during Aatrox.

9. F6 Golem Rushing:

* Requirements: Cata 25+ and a high DPS weapon, preferably Bonemerangs or FoT, and Hyperion for maximum efficiency.
* Rates: 800k per hour without pots or pet, likely around 20% worse without Hyperion. With pots and a wolf, it can reach
  1.4m XP per hour. Involves using a bot to enter a solo F6, rushing blood, killing golems, and making a good profit
  from roses.

11. Ghost Grinding:

* Requirements: Soul Whip, combat 30-35+, and good accessories. Necron armor recommended, but Sup armor is better for
  profit.
* Rates: Up to 900k per hour with any pet, but likely around 700-800k per hour with lower stats. Best spot is the open
  area below Royal Mines. Agro ghosts with a circular run and hit them all with Soul Whip. Earn good profit from
  Sorrows.

13. F6 Golem Rushing with Terra farming:

* Requirements: Cata 35+, Hyperion, and a Bone Archer setup.
* Rates: 1.5m+ per hour, with high Cata it can exceed 2m per hour. Rush blood with Hyperion, kill golems and farm
  Terras, then kill Giants and Sadan as fast as possible. High Cata is necessary to tank and kill Terras quickly. Drink
  combat XP and Viking's Tear potions at the start of a run.

There is also a method of self pearl spamming, but the rates are unknown. Check out Something Like That's YouTube
channel for more information. Additionally, F4 combat grinding is a good alternative to T3 Revs, but the rates are
similar and it was not included in its own section. It involves using a Spirit Scepter to farm animals in the boss
fight.
