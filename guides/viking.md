The Melancholic Viking is an NPC that spawns in The Park island, located on a smaller island in the spruce tree section.
He has a shop that is locked behind a small task that you need to complete to unlock his shop.

His shop once he has been turned into the Joyful Viking consists of:

- The Viking's Tear
- Travel Scroll To The Jungle Island
- Raider Axe
- Experience IV Book

To unlock his shop, you will need:

- Fish Hat
- Magical Water Bucket
- Two Raw Fish
- 200 Intelligence

How to unlock it?

- Place a Raw Fish in the Furnaces found in his home.
- Start to splash by crouching with the fish hat ability.
- Put water in the fireplace using the magical water bucket.
- Keep splashing with Raw Fish in hand until his shop opens once the Viking has been struck by lightning.

Extra:  
There is a fairy soul on the roof of the Hut where the Viking lives.

## FAQ  

### How can I get enough intelligence?
- You can put Wise on armor using Blacksmith Reforges
- Mana Potions

### Are there any easier ways?
- Other people can unlock the shop for you, but that may need some asking around and such.

### What should I buy?
- The Raider Axe is a strong early game weapon and the Travel Scroll is helpful but requires MVP+ to use.

There you have it, you now have accessed the Melancholic Viking's Shop.
