## Ender Dragons - Dragon's Nest

The Dragon's Nest is the home of the Dragon Egg, Zealots, Obsidian Defender, Watcher and Endstone Protectors. There are
a total of 7 Ender Dragons which is a guarantee spawn after placing 8 Summoning Eyes at the altar. Once placed there is
a chance that the Ender Dragon is one of the following:

- Protector 16%  
- Old 16%  
- Unstable 16%  
- Young 16%  
- Strong 16%  
- Wise 16%  
- Superior 4%

Each dragon has its own abilities and has a wide range of its own drops, for chance to obtain one of the drops you
have to count for a Quality system which is based upon where you place on the leaderboard and how many eyes you palace
in the altar.

We have a guide on Ender Dragon's located here: [How To Beat The Ender Dragon](https://skykings.net/guides/ender-dragon).

Also, underneath the entrance to the Dragon's Nest there's a area where you can salvage various end drops and dragon
items in return for Dragon Essense and other items but in particular, you can spend Dragon Essense at the shop NPC to
unlock a range of buffs such as Bonus Summoning Eye drops, Superior chance and more.

There is a questline that The End island has which you can follow through the Lost Adveturers chat dialogue by starting
it at the entrance [Lone Adventurer Quest](https://skykings.net/guides/lone-adventurer).
