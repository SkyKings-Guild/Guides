With skyblock being a game all about money, people try to find all the easy way for 
making easy coins, and composter happens to be one of the best passive mmm out there,
treat just as another minion slot!

Before we begin, I recommend checking https://tinyurl.com/trueffsheet as it contains
very useful resources that could help with this!

Now, I am assuming you have at least lvl 5 of all upgrades in the composter, thought
higher levels are always a plus, after that is met, use volta and box of seeds to 
run the composter as this is usually the best way to run it.

Now make sure to check on the sheet that I linked if you want to squeeze every single 
coin for profit!
