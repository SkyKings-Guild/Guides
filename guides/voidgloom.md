Voidglooms are one of the hardest bosses in skyblock but beating them can give powerful rewards. This guide will take
you through the requirements to solo them and the way you kill them.

### Mods

- Skytils
    - Skytils (/st) is one of the best free skyblock mods you can get with many useful features for all aspects of the
      game. It contains most of the voidgloom modifications required to do them properly.
- Shyhanni
    - Skyhanni (/sh) is best alternate to b=paid mods like SBE ,it provides complete Voidglooms QOL also gets updated frequently

These 2 mods contain settings to help out with voidglooms. You can customise them as you like but you need to have a
beacon/head highlight setting on. This will highlight beacons and heads to make them more visible which helps out with
the boss greatly.

## Boss mechanics

Each tier of the boss has very high damage and defensive stats. This table shows the specific details of each.

### Statistics:

| Tier | Health      | DPS    | Hitshield Hits |
|------|-------------|--------|----------------|
| T4   | 210,000,000 | 21,000 | 100            |
| T3   | 50,000,000  | 12,000 | 60             |
| T2   | 12,000,000  | 4,000  | 30             |
| T1   | 300,000     | 1,200  | 15             | 

### Abilities

- Dissonance - Every few seconds the boss teleports behind or to the side of the player. It cannot teleport while the
  hitshield is active. - 50% of dps is converted into magic damage (AOE) while 50% stays as melee damage.

- Malevolent Hitshield - Gains a shield for 15 / 30 / 60 / 100 hits which is reduced per hit (not damage). This starts
  at 100% / 66% / 33% hp for all tiers. - While the shield is active the boss takes full ferocity hits and when it's
  inactive the boss takes -75% ferocity hits. - The shield increases the boss's dps by 3000 dps every 3 seconds it is
  active for. This is for T3 / T4 only. The bonus dps dissipates when the shield is destroyed.

- Yang Glyphs - The boss holds a beacon for 2 seconds then will throw it in a random direction. This starts at 66% hp
  after the hitshield for T2 / T3 / T4. - To break the beacon you need to stand next to it at feet level or stand on top
  of it. - If you fail to break the beacon within 5 seconds of it landing you will take 1000 x Max Health as true
  damage. - Yang Glyphs cannot be thrown during hitshields but can be thrown during Broken Heart Radiation

- Nukekubi Fixations - The boss spawns heads every 7-8 seconds. These heads float around the player. This starts at 33%
  hp after the hitshield for T3 / T4. - The heads can be destroyed by looking at them for 0.5s. - They deal 800 dps at
  T3 and 2000 dps at T4 and their base dps is doubled for each other head alive.

- Broken Heart Radiation - Halfway between hitshields the boss becomes immune to all damage and casts rotating beams. -
  Touching a beam deals 25% of your max hp as true damage and reduces incoming healing by 12% for 90s (stacks). - Any
  players outside the radius of the beams or within 2.5 blocks of the boss take 10% of their max hp every 0.5 seconds.

## How to kill Voidglooms

Having the gear to kill voidglooms and actually killing them are 2 very different things. There are a few important
steps you must take to kill the boss. Before spawning the boss you want to have an organized inventory. If you are a
scroll wheeler I would recommend keeping your weapon and wand right next to each other to make cycling healing /
ferocity way easier. Having your wither blade and aspect of the end / aspect of the void in an easily accessible slot
helps a lot with quick heals / teleports. If you are a hotkeyer customize your items however you wish as long as you can
cycle your weapon / wand easily. Spawning the boss in a more wide open location can also help. The best place to spawn
T3 / T4 is the top of the Void Sepulture.

### Tier 1

When the boss spawns start cycling wand heals every 7 seconds and hit it 15 times to break the hitshield then damage it
then repeat until it's dead.

### Tier 2

When the boss spawns start cycling wand heals and soulcry ability for ferocity every 4 seconds. If you are struggling on
mana you can cycle them separately to make full use of the 7 second duration of the wand but it is harder. If you have
summons you can summon them and try to get them agroing the boss during the hitshields. Keep a distance if using summons
but stay close so they don't teleport to you. Summons will be automatically despawned at the end of each hitphase. If
not, cycle your wand and ferocity to destroy it as fast as possible. Once it's down you can damage the boss until the
next hitshield. After you destroy that one beacons will start spawning. Once one spawns try to damage the boss for as
long as possible but save enough time to get to stand next to or on top of the beacon before it explodes. Beacons can
also get stuck in hard to reach places behind walls sometimes which can make it harder. Repeat this process after the
final hitshield to kill the boss. If you have a power orb like a mana flux it can greatly help but you have to replace
it after some time. If you get really low you can use your florid to get quick heals also.

### Tier 3

When the boss spawns you want to spawn your summons and get them to agro the boss while staying back a bit. The longer
the hitshield is up the stronger the boss gets so try to destroy it quickly and keep out of its range. Once it's
destroyed you can start to attack the boss and cycle your wand and katana abilities. Try not to get hit by melee hits
because half of it's damage will come from melee hits so you will take a lot more damage. Once it gets to the next
hitshield respawn your summons and repeat what you did at the start. After it's destroyed you have to watch out for
beacons. Like T2 they can get stuck behind walls and sometimes be a pain to get. After you destroy the final hitphase.
Heads will appear around every 7-8 seconds. While damaging the boss, aim yourself to target the heads to destroy them
without breaking your dps. Beacons spawn along with the heads so it can be hard to manage. Heads can sometimes spawn
behind walls and mods don't work all the time so keep an eye out for stray heads blending in with the walls. By
destroying heads and beacons while keeping a good amount of dps on the boss you can kill it very fast.

### Tier 4

The start is mostly the same as T3 with a few differences. The boss does way more damage so occasionally you will have
to use a florid charge or wither impact when you get low. You start cycling after destroying the hitshield with summons.
When it gets to 175m hp it activates broken heart radiation. It will become immune to damage and starts to emit rotating
beams 3 blocks high. You can jump over these beams with jump boost from a god pot but if you get hit you will get a
reduction in healing for 90 seconds which can affect you greatly during the boss. After 8 seconds the beams stop and you
can attack the boss like normal. Once you get past the second hitshield the boss starts to throw beacons. At 105m hp it
will activate broken heart radiation again. During this the boss can also throw beacons so watch out for beacons while
the beams are rotating. Once you get past the third hitshield the boss will spawn heads. 3 heads will double the boss's
total dps so make sure you get rid of most of them. At 35m hp the final broken heart radiation phase will activate.
During this both heads and beacons can be summoned so you will have to get beacons while jumping over the beams and
getting rid of heads. As long as you don't let too many heads spawn the boss will be easy to kill. Ender artifact is
very expensive but makes a huge difference and can make it like 10x easier.
