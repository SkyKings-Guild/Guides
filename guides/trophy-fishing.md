Armor:

The best armor for Trophy fishing is the Bronze, Silver, Gold, Diamond Trophy Hunter armor sets obtained from Odger
after catching every fish in each tier of fish.

This armor allows immunity to sea creatures, while not allowing you to damage them. Along with the ability to no longer
catch any sea creatures.

The second ability is a percentage increase in chance to catch trophy fish starting at 0 for bronze then going up by 5%
each tier respectively.

This armor can also be starred to 10 stars using magmafish, heavy pearls, and coins . It is advised to fully star the
armor at bronze tier as the stars carry over to higher tier upgrades but much less resources are required.

Rod:

The best rod for Trophy Fishing is a Hellfire rod with 'Pitchin' reforge. This reforge can be applied with a pitchin'
koi reforge stone. Along with the reforge the attributes that are best for the rod/trophy fishing are 'Trophy Hunter X'
and 'Fishing Speed X'

On your rod amongst all normal fishing enchants you also want to make sure you have Charm 5, which gives higher % to
catch trophy fish and Flash 5 which gives a chance to instantly catch a fish after casting.

The Hellfire rod, like the armor, can also be 10 starred. In order to star the rod it takes in total:

5,090 Crimson Essence, 20 Lump of magma, 226 Silver Magmafish, 120 Gold Magmafish, 20 Moogma Pelt, 20 Pyroclastic Scale,
70 Flaming Heart, 50 Cup of Blood, 80 Orb of Energy, 90 Horn of Taurus, 12 Heavy Pearls, 30 Thunder Shards, 55 Magma
Lord Fragments.

After all this all you need is about 500-1,000 hours of dedication and a lot of patience in order to catch all the
Trophy Fish.
