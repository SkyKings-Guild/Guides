Method 1 (Frozen Scythe) Full Wise Armour Heroic Frozen Scythe Sheep Pet or Legendary Enderman Sighted Accessory
Modifier Aspect of the End/Void Zealuck Perk in End Shop (Optional) Rogue Sword Run around quickly using the Frozen
Scythe's ability to 1 shot zealots easily and get eyes very fast. No Crit Chance needed! (Moderately cheap, easy)

Method 2 (Melee) 13k+ Damage on Crit (100% Crit-Chance, preferably use a Livid Dagger for Crit-Chance and attack speed
but optional) God Potion Any armor Legendary Enderman Pet (Optional) Zealuck Perk (Optional) Not as good as the Frozen
Scythe Method but still works and can make you some moderate money. (Cheap, easy)

Method 3 (Precursor Eye) ¾ Storm or Wise with Precursor Eye Spirit Sceptre in hand Legendary Sheep Pet w/ Textbook
Sighted Accessory Modifier Rogue Sword Aspect of the End/Void Maxed Zealuck Perk Much better than both methods but
substantially more expensive (Expensive, Easy, FAST)
